# Member removal

Home administrators have the power to remove members from the home.

## Removing a member

The administrator can also decide whether to hide the removed member's posts and comments.

## Being removed as a member

Because Quarter doesn't store a plain-text version of member e-mails, the user will not be notified until they try to log in again.

Upon logging in, a message will be displayed, explaining that they have been removed from the home, optionally attached with a message from the home administrator.

On this page, they can choose to export all of their data, including all of their posts and comments.

### Account expiration

Depending on the Quarter host's setup and terms of service, the account might expire after a set amount of inactivity (that is, time without any logins).
